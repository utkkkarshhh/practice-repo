Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm based on the input size. It shows how the time of an algorithm will increase if the input size increases.

The size of input = input size (n)

Whenever we talk about time compplexity, we are computing it for the worst case scenario, we keep only the worst case scenario in our consideration.

Why Time Complexity:
1. To write more optimised algorithms, to build better systems.
2. To compare two different algorithms on the grounds of how they would perform. For example O(n) v/s O(n^2)

Linear Time Complexity -> O(n) | Amount of operations increases if the input size increases.

Big O Notation:
Big O notation provides the upper bound on the growth of an algorithm. It describes how the running time increases in the worst case as input size grows.

Theta Notation:
Theta notation provides the tight bound on the growth of an algorithm. It shows the exact order of growth, meaning both the upper and lower bounds are the same.

Omega Notation:
Omega notation provides the lower bound on the growth of an algorithm. It describes the best case, i.e., the minimum time an algorithm will take.
